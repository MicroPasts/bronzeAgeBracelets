## 3D Model Metadata ##

This is an informal set of metadata for a 3D model produced via the MicroPasts crowdsourcing web platform (http://crowdsourced.micropasts.org).

### General Information ###

This object is nested Bronze Age gold bracelets that were found in a hoard of other goldwork near Woolaston, Gloucestershire, UK.

### Available Data ###

We have created three models: a textured mesh with 100k faces, another with 300k faces, and the original dense point cloud. The raw images, image masks and exported information about camera position and alignment markers are also available.

### Processing and Quality Assessment ###

This model was created in PhotoScan Pro 1.1.0.

The fact that the object is fairly small by comparison to the background has some consequences for the quality of the final model, and the images were processed in several separate sets and then combined. The final model is adequate for many purposes, but surface detail is sometimes under-represented. Note that we did not colour-balance the photographs.
